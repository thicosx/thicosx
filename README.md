<h1>Hello!</h1>

<p>I always love coding. Since I was a kid I always was fascinating about this world. My mom gave me a computer when I was 16 years old and my first website was build using MS Word. As I used to love skateboard, I built a website called "Furia Radical" and I used to print many advertisement and go house by house putting those advertisement in my neighbor's mailbox.</p>

<p>Then I started playing CS 1.5 and I built a website about it, but this time using MS Front Page. Later another website called "Vipbalada" where I had so many views and visitors, but this time I built using Dreamweaver.</p>

<p>I never stopped since this. I always am bulding different websites, some of them I already abandoned, some not. I also used to love mIRC, by that time I built a skin to the original mIRC software, and It was so cool. I also used so many times MSN Messenger, ICQ and Orkut. Great times!</p>

<p>Now I am learning different languages, different programming languages, trying to be a better person everyday. Living my american dream, trying to conquer my space in this crazy world.</p>
