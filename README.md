WELCOME TO MY GRUBHUB PROFILE!

<hr>

<p>I always love coding. Since I was a kid I always was fascinating about this world. My mom gave me a computer when I was 16 years old and my first website was build using MS Word. As I used to love skateboard, I built a website called "Furia Radical" and I used to print many advertisement and also I used to go house by house putting those advertisement in my neighbors mailbox.</p>

<p>Than I started playing CS 1.5 and I built a website about it, but this time using MS Front Page. Later another website called "Vipbalada" where I had so many views and visitors, but this time I built using Dreamweaver.</p>

<p>I never stopped since this. I always am bulding different websites, some of them I aalready bandoned, some not.</p>
